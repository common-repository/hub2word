Close the gap between WordPress and HubSpot content and accessibility.

== Description ==

Hub2Word's goal is to simplify the management of content between HubSpot and WordPress. Hub2Word connects to your HubSpot portal to allow for easy embed of HubSpot forms, search HubSpot blog posts, and embed HubSpot CTAs. More information about HubSpot can be found here: https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing

= Features =

Hub2Word currently includes the following features:

* WordPress site search also searches HubSpot blog posts. Any HubSpot blog, landing page, or site page that matches the search phrase is displayed in the WordPress search results page.
* Latest Post Widget for HubSpot blogs. 
* HubSpot Forms as Shortcode. In the WordPress Editor, you can choose which HubSpot form you would like to embed on the page. Shortcode is added to the WordPress content editor and will display the HubSpot form on the front end.
* CTA shortcode embed. Paste CTA javascript code into the page meta, then use the shortcode to place the CTA on the page.
* HubSpot link generator. Quickly add links to HubSpot landing pages, blogs, and site pages from within the WordPress editor.
* HubSpot file manager. Similar to how the WP media manager works, you will be able to navigate the HubSpot file manager from within your WP editor and insert any media into your WordPress post content.

*You can view the plugin in action in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr_OWtBPRrg5JWje7Ht8iFw?view_as=subscriber" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.
